# Life's a Drag
## My First Game
Welcome to the first software game I ever developed. I wrote this in HTML, CSS Flex and Javascript. I hope you enjoy it. 

## Description
This is a simple image puzzle game. The objective is to complete the original image by repositioning image tiles. On one side, you will see a collection of shuffled image tiles. Select and move image tiles, one-at-a-time to a correct box in the drop zone grid. The completed image will emerge once all the pieces are correctly in place.

## How to Play
1. Refresh your screen to reshuffle the pieces. 
2. Move an image tile by using a drag-and-drop method: 
    * Select an image piece by clicking on it and holding the click button down. 
    * Move a piece by holding down the click down, while simultaneously moving your mouse.
    * Your mouse movement drags the image piece. 
    * Release the click button to drop the piece into position. 
3. An alert will display informing you if the piece is in the correct grid box or not. 
4. Refresh your screen at any time during the game to restart and reshuffle.

## Levels of Play:
#### Round One
You're presented an image puzzle with 9 evenly sized tiles awaiting your keen attention to visual detail. Complete this round by placing all image pieces unto the correct grid box.

#### Round Two
You're presented an image puzzle with 16 pieces awaiting your keen attention to visual detail and clues. Complete this round by placing all image pieces unto the correct grid box.

#### Round Three
You're presented an image puzzle with 25 pieces awaiting your keen attention to visual detail,clues and patience. Complete this round by placing all image pieces unto the correct grid box.

## Additional Information
* Timers and points have been excluded to allow for the simple enjoyment of completing the puzzle. 
* I hope to return to this project in the future to add more features. 
* There is a strange bug, where if I continue to zoom out to about 25%, eventually the drop zone breaks. It's a behavior I don't think many users ever do with their browser.

#### W3 Schools
I learned a lot from playing with [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) lessons on their site. The site helped me with understanding drag & drop, event listeners and refining my understanding of structuring functions. 

#### Fisher Yates Algorithm
I tried out a bunch of different shuffling algorithms for mixing up my image pieces. In my research I read a lot about the deficiencies, and the "not so random" phenomenon, ailing other algorithms that came before Fisher Yates. I also like the eloquence of the code, which makes it easy to implement. Here's a great article that explains the evolution: [Fisher Yates Shuffle by Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)
