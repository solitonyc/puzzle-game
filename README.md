#Life's a Drag
##My First Game
Welcome to the first game I ever developed. It's written in HTML, CSS Flex and Javascript. I hope you enjoy it. This project was assigned to me as a student of General Assembly in NYC, studying web Development.

##Description
This is a simple image puzzle, game. On one side, you will see a collection of sliced, image tiles. These images tiles are all shuffled. The objective, is to take tile pieces, one at a time from this collection bin, and correctly place the tiles onto a grid in the drop zone, on the other side in order to complete the original picture.

##How to Play
Press refresh to reshuffle the pieces. Select an image piece by clicking on it. Move the piece by holding down the click, while simultaneously moving your mouse to a proper box on the drop-zone grid. Once you are ready to drop the piece, just let go of the click button. An alert will display informing you if the piece is in the correct box or not.

##Levels of Play
####Round One: 
An image puzzle with 9 evenly sized tiles awaits your keen attention to visual details. Complete this round by placing all image pieces unto the correct grid box.

####Round Two:
An image puzzle with 16 pieces awaits your keen attention to visual detail and clues. Complete this round by placing all image pieces unto the correct grid box.

####Round Three:
An image puzzle with 25 pieces awaits your keen attention to visual detail, clues and patience. Complete this round by placing all image pieces unto the correct grid box.

##Credits
####W3 Schools
I learned a lot from playing with [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) lessons on their site. The site helped me with understanding drag & drop, event listeners and refining my understanding of structuring functions. 

###Fisher Yates
I tried out a bunch of different shuffling algorithms for the image pieces. In my research I read a lot about the deficiencies, and the "not so random" deficiencies of other shuffling algorithms that came before Fisher Yates. I also like the eloquence of the code. Here's a great article that explains the evolution: [Fisher Yates Shuffle by Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)


####WDI Staff at General Assembly
Last but not least, I want to thank the talented TAs assigned to my Terabyte cohort at General Assembly for their generous time and consultation. They helped me diagnose and overcome numerous bugs and blockers. And in the process I learned a lot.
